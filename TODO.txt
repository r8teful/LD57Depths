TERRAFORMING: 
1. Basic numbers and slider visuals
- Oxygen value goes up as you place more trees
	- Should have a current value, and an ending value, which gets reached when the tree is at its max
	- Slider visual that shows you this. When you hoover over the slider it tells you how long before it reaches the max
- Lamp light value
- Polution cleaned value
- Global value that combines all of the three above
2. Reacting Components
- Background particles react to polution cleaned
- Bubbles spawn when more oxygen
- Global light reacts to global value
- Plants dynamically start to spawn when certain thresholds are reached
	- For areas that aren't discovered, we can increase the spawn ratio depending on the global value
