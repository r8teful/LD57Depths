* Make a luck stat, it effects ore drop amount, and item rarity

#### Long range items



* Bouncing ball: Collides with objects, bounces around and damages blocks
* Fish gun: Shoots a pyranya in the mining direction, it destroys blocks infront



* Fix the submarine

Its very broken right now when you enter it





Later:

* Solo playtest and make ALL values reasonable

 	- Upgrade values

 	- Cost values

 	- Ore spawn values

 	- Cave and biome size

After this you may do internal playtest with Lucy
