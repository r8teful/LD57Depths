IS THE GAME FUN??





Hover over base nodes to see what it is and possibly their current stats



Iron drops way to much each node. Maybe this is good?



MAKE THE MINING MORE SATISFYING



* Having actual veins is way more satisfying to mine, it just feels more rewarding mining the whole thing and not the ores being scattered around, Also fuller veins look more satisfying, like a whole block of it looks cool
* Need a counter of the ores you're collecting because it is satisfying to see it go up





Blocks ARE enemies, you MINE/defeat them and gain a REWARD



Procedural world -> your advantage! Utilize it! Is it bad to have a base? NO its good, but maybe you can teleport? You want to be able to go FAR from your base swimming back the same way is boring! 



* you SHOULD have different ways to change up the generation as you progress, it could be cool to have UPGRADES focus on this.
* Would be cool if ENTITIES could effect gameplay, and maybe these could be generated as well



Upgrade three is the "base"

Then there are items that enhance the base.
