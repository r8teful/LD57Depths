Add description to the upgrades?



* Visual for when going low on oxygen
* Need some kind of tutorial / reminder of using the brimstone ability
* Test how the game feels with block break sounds - EH idk its more satisfying but the sound has to be really good 





* Add exploration entities



Things that are good:

First upgrade with the player damage and upgrade fixing is nice. You can do it in one oxygen run. Okay the first 10 minutes or so is good now. Up until the lazer blast and oxygen length. Now next would be to think about how we can go from here...

 

consider the fact that players could be going down, have some kind of bedrock layer. Edit world ore spawns in GetOreDefinitions to start from bedrock etc....







Steamdeck notes:

* Icons not updating correctly for controller
* Can't go into submarine
* When I went into the sub it didn't cull any world things and didn't go into walk state
* Should a start menu with settings to change full screen mode etc...
* Also the block texture seems zoomed in...
