Add description to the upgrades?



* Visual for when going low on oxygen
* Make ores (alot) more harder to mine
* Need some kind of tutorial / reminder of using the brimstone ability
* vfx juice for upgrade ui fix here: https://github.com/Demigiant/dotween/issues/427



* Add exploration entities
* Add biome essence







Things that are good:

First upgrade with the player damage and upgrade fixing is nice. You can do it in one oxygen run. Okay the first 10 minutes or so is good now. Up until the lazer blast and oxygen length. Now next would be to think about how we can go from here...

 

consider the fact that players could be going down, have some kind of bedrock layer. Edit world ore spawns in GetOreDefinitions to start from bedrock etc....





Abilities notes:





Solo playtest the shit out of everything and make ALL values reasonable

 	- Upgrade values

 	- Cost values

 	- Ore spawn values

 	- Cave and biome size

After this you may do internal playtest with Lucy





Steamdeck notes:

* Icons not updating correctly for controller
* Can't go into submarine
* When I went into the sub it didn't cull any world things and didn't go into walk state
* Should a start menu with settings to change full screen mode etc...
