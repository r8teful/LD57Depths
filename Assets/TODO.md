* Add ore drop upgrade
* Make a luck stat, it effects ore drop amount, and item rarity 





* Fix the submarine, decide if you still want the sub fixing entities





Later:

* Solo playtest the shit out of everything and make ALL values reasonable

 	- Upgrade values

 	- Cost values

 	- Ore spawn values

 	- Cave and biome size

After this you may do internal playtest with Lucy
