Add description to the upgrades?



* Need some kind of tutorial / reminder of using the brimstone ability
* Test how the game feels with block break sounds - EH idk its more satisfying but the sound has to be really good





* Add exploration entities



* Add biome essence to recipes
* Implement chest loot system
* Implement buff loot system
* Implement events





Things that are good:

First upgrade with the player damage and upgrade fixing is nice. You can do it in one oxygen run. Okay the first 10 minutes or so is good now. Up until the lazer blast and oxygen length. Now next would be to think about how we can go from here...

 

consider the fact that players could be going down, have some kind of bedrock layer. Edit world ore spawns in GetOreDefinitions to start from bedrock etc....







Steamdeck notes:

* Icons not updating correctly for controller
* Can't go into submarine
* Should a start menu with settings to change full screen mode etc...
* Also the block texture seems zoomed in... - WHY!?

**Smaller visual stuff:**

* sub Background is too plain \& submarine seems boring and lifeless
* Interactable things should also have a stroke "highlight"
* Upgrade tree header in ui
* No units in upgrades
* Don't let submarine spawn inside a rock
* World background too blurry
* Particles look like copper



Gameplay

* Not sure what to do at the start, needs a bit more handholding
* Hard to notice improvement
* Forget to use lazer blast \& what button it needs to activate
* Lazer blast too powerful
* Actual lazer cooldown visual 



Upgrades

* Make the pacing faster <- THIS
* Using up all of one resource will not remove it from the sub UI 
* Stone is most common so that could be for fixing the cables?
