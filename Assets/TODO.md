* Finish player upgrades, CHECK THEM AND ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THEY WORK, ALL OF THEM!!

&nbsp;	- I think its just dash upgrading left 

&nbsp;	- Decide what ore spawning upgrades you want

* Make a levelling system and add purchasable abilities for it

&nbsp;	- What abilities? 

* Fix the submarine

Its very broken right now when you enter it





Later:

* Solo playtest and make ALL values reasonable

&nbsp;	- Upgrade values

&nbsp;	- Cost values

&nbsp;	- Ore spawn values

&nbsp;	- Cave and biome size

After this you may do internal playtest with Lucy
