Add description to the upgrades?



* Need some kind of tutorial / reminder of using the brimstone ability
* Test how the game feels with block break sounds - EH idk its more satisfying but the sound has to be really good





* Add exploration entities



* Add biome essence to recipes
* Implement chest loot system
* Implement buff loot system
* Implement events





Things that are good:

First upgrade with the player damage and upgrade fixing is nice. You can do it in one oxygen run. Okay the first 10 minutes or so is good now. Up until the lazer blast and oxygen length. Now next would be to think about how we can go from here...

 

consider the fact that players could be going down, have some kind of bedrock layer. Edit world ore spawns in GetOreDefinitions to start from bedrock etc....



For the nodes its important that whatever its connected is somewhat related to the node

POLISH NEEDED FOR DEMO:

* Upgrade progress should look animated / cooler, more exciting!!
* Use more particles in the ui, even when its just stationary, like extra cool subtle things around a big upgrade node



Steamdeck notes:

* Icons not updating correctly for controller
* Should a start menu with settings to change full screen mode etc...
* Also the block texture seems zoomed in... - WHY!? This also happens in windows build

**Smaller visual stuff:**

* Upgrade tree header in ui
* Don't let submarine spawn inside a rock, and don't let anything "block" the sub, like plants spawn in front of it
* Don't let structure entities spawn in the trench
* Make popup fade out instead of disappear instant
* Items go From bob to PC? -> Visually show it go from bob to pc, and make the PC bounce or something (show that its receiving it)
* New color node with one upgrade but not getting one upgrade
* Hitstop when buying a node!?
* Add cool particles to UI 

&nbsp;	1. Particle when available

&nbsp;	2. Particle when cooler upgrade

&nbsp;	3. Cool shader on the outline of the node for extra cool upgrade. Several nodes have this effect but with different colours

* Remove progress numbers!
* Make node move a bit when selected 
* Animate interaction (fade in, move up slightly)

UX:

* Not sure what to do at the start, needs a bit more handholding. Arrow pointing at upgrade machine!?
* Forget to use lazer blast \& what button it needs to activate
* You don't know where the beepbeep sound is comming from -> Make it clear that it comes from the oxygen bar running out
* Clarify that all three upgrades need to happen for you to move
* UI Doesn't tell you anything, it needs to be clear how to progress further!!

Misc:

* Should not fix the upgrade panel from the upgrade panel
* Cactus particle effect?? When you turn into one
* MAKE SETTINGS (good for debugging, like disabling the background, fullscreen modes etc
* Chest should explode into lil pickups which then give you that same pickup sound
* Big node doesn't really look like you can buy it

Coding:

* The other upgrades, like the block oxygen, lazer blast, lazer chain, make them better, it feels wrong, it just costs like 2 iron to buy, its not satisfying, make it cost somewhat mored
* crit damage?
* Biome placement should not change with same seed



PACING:

* Make movement slower on the next layer, higher up -> More dense. Could have the same with oxygen!!

ADD MORE STUFF!

* Add exploration entity content
