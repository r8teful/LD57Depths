Add description to the upgrades?



* Need some kind of tutorial / reminder of using the brimstone ability
* Test how the game feels with block break sounds - EH idk its more satisfying but the sound has to be really good





* Add exploration entities



* Add biome essence to recipes
* Implement chest loot system
* Implement buff loot system
* Implement events





Things that are good:

First upgrade with the player damage and upgrade fixing is nice. You can do it in one oxygen run. Okay the first 10 minutes or so is good now. Up until the lazer blast and oxygen length. Now next would be to think about how we can go from here...

 

consider the fact that players could be going down, have some kind of bedrock layer. Edit world ore spawns in GetOreDefinitions to start from bedrock etc....



For the nodes its important that whatever its connected is somewhat related to the node

POLISH NEEDED FOR DEMO:

* Upgrade progress should look animated / cooler, more exciting!!
* Use more particles in the ui, even when its just stationary, like extra cool subtle things around a big upgrade node



Steamdeck notes:

* Icons not updating correctly for controller
* Can't go into submarine
* Should a start menu with settings to change full screen mode etc...
* Also the block texture seems zoomed in... - WHY!? This also happens in windows build

**Smaller visual stuff:**

* Upgrade tree header in ui
* Don't let submarine spawn inside a rock, and don't let anything "block" the sub, like plants spawn in front of it
* Don't let structure entities spawn in the trench
* Make popup fade out instead of disappear instant
* Items go From bob to PC? -> Visually show it go from bob to pc, and make the PC bounce or something (show that its receiving it)
* New color node with one upgrade but not getting one upgrade
* Add black background when in sub

UX:

* Not sure what to do at the start, needs a bit more handholding
* Forget to use lazer blast \& what button it needs to activate
* You don't know where the beepbeep sound is comming from -> Make it clear that it comes from the oxygen bar running out
* Clarify that all three upgrades need to happen for you to move

Misc:

* Should not fix the upgrade panel from the upgrade panel
* Ores should feel more rare? just feels like you find everything all the time
* Cactus particle effect?? When you turn into one
* MAKE SETTINGS (good for debugging, like disabling the background, fullscreen modes etc



PACING:

* Doesn't have the feeling of getting strong really fast
* Doesn't feel like I'm upgrading enough, I feel like I should upgrade more things each time
* Still drags out for too long you want something else
* Make movement slower on the next layer, higher up -> More dense. Could have the same with oxygen!!
* BRO, EASE INTO THINGS, DON'T GO 100%, START WITH STONE, THEN COPPER, THEN IRON, THEN GOLD, ITS THAT EASY, 3MIN ISH EACH



Upgrade that shows the way back?

Upgrade that lets you only lose some of your items



First to smaller QOL things, then you do big boy balancing! List is too long now
