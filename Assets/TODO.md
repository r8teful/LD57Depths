* Make a luck stat, it effects ore drop amount, and item rarity 
* Fix the submarine, decide if you still want the sub fixing entities



* Add upgrades to the abilities, do this now!? Yes

&nbsp;	- Make sure they all have PROPER base stat values

&nbsp;	- 



Shockwave - DONE 

Boomerang - 





Later:

* Solo playtest the shit out of everything and make ALL values reasonable

 	- Upgrade values

 	- Cost values

 	- Ore spawn values

 	- Cave and biome size

After this you may do internal playtest with Lucy
