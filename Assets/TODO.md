Add description to the upgrades?



* Visual for when going low on oxygen
* Make lazer thicker
* Make lazer handling stop remembinging pos
* Remove icons with interactables



* Need some kind of debug visual showing the rings of the ores because its imposable to tell we're theyre actually spawning and we need it to make the game good



Things that are good:

First upgrade with the player damage and upgrade fixing is nice. You can do it in one oxygen run, ak, 60 sec. This si



Consider the fact that players could be going down, have some kind of bedrock layer. Edit world ore spawns in GetOreDefinitions to start from bedrock etc....





Abilities notes:





Solo playtest the shit out of everything and make ALL values reasonable

 	- Upgrade values

 	- Cost values

 	- Ore spawn values

 	- Cave and biome size

After this you may do internal playtest with Lucy
