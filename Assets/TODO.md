Add description to the upgrades?



* Need some kind of tutorial / reminder of using the brimstone ability
* Test how the game feels with block break sounds - EH idk its more satisfying but the sound has to be really good





* Add exploration entities



* Add biome essence to recipes
* Implement chest loot system
* Implement buff loot system
* Implement events





Things that are good:

First upgrade with the player damage and upgrade fixing is nice. You can do it in one oxygen run. Okay the first 10 minutes or so is good now. Up until the lazer blast and oxygen length. Now next would be to think about how we can go from here...

 

consider the fact that players could be going down, have some kind of bedrock layer. Edit world ore spawns in GetOreDefinitions to start from bedrock etc....



For the nodes its important that whatever its connected is somewhat related to the node





Steamdeck notes:

* Icons not updating correctly for controller
* Can't go into submarine
* Should a start menu with settings to change full screen mode etc...
* Also the block texture seems zoomed in... - WHY!?

**Smaller visual stuff:**

* Upgrade tree header in ui
* Don't let submarine spawn inside a rock, and don't let anything "block" the sub, like plants spawn in front of it 
* World background too blurry
* Particles look like copper \& Don't seem to despawn
* Make popup fade out instead of disappear instant





Gameplay

* Not sure what to do at the start, needs a bit more handholding
* Forget to use lazer blast \& what button it needs to activate
* Should not fix the upgrade panel from the upgrade panel
* Speed should not be connected to oxygen? Brain things that upgrade is related to oxygen because its branching FROM the oxygen
* Bar should have more divisions
* Doesn't have the feeling of getting strong really fast
* Ores should feel more rare? just feels like you find everything all the time
* Oxygen should have a value instead of procent?
* You don't know where the beepbeep sound is comming from -> Make it clear that it comes from the oxygen bar running out
* Expected the blast to fire when pressing space, not when holding the lazer button
* Dies -> Frustrating but deserved. But seems like she made it, but still didn't. Maybe have even extra long when you're close to sub
* Rename acceleration to movement control
* Doesn't feel like I'm upgrading enough, I feel like I should upgrade more things each time
* Switch lazer damage with range
* New color node with one upgrade but not getting one upgrade
* Background doesn't match with
* Cactus particle effect?? When you turn into one
* Still drags out for too long you want something else
* Make movement slower on the next layer, higher up -> More dense. Could have the same with oxygen!!
* Clarify that all three upgrades need to happen for you to move
* Items go From bob to PC? -> Visually show it go from bob to pc, and make the PC bounce or something (show that its receiving it)



Upgrade that shows the way back?

Upgrade that lets you only lose some of your items
